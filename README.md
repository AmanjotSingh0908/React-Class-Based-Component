Class-based components extend the React.Component class and provide access to features such as state and lifecycle methods like componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount.

Lifecycle Methods:
componentDidMount() is called after the component is added to the DOM.
componentDidUpdate() logs changes whenever the state or props are updated.
componentWillUnmount() is called just before the component is removed from the DOM.
